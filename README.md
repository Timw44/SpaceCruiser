# SpaceCruiser

Space Cruiser is a arcade style infinite runner android game that was developed as a school project. It allows the player to control a drone flight in space as they help clean
space by eliminating debris and UFOs. There is another object in space that proves programers have solved space travel. You will have to play it yourself to find out what it is!

# How to play?

The app can be downloaded off the google play store. Touching the left side of the screen moves the ship left and touching the right side moves it to the right.
Also, the ship is constantly shooting so no work needed for that.
